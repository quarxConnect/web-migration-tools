# Tools for migration of websites
This repository contains a set of tools used by our support-team to
migrate websites and applications from foreign webhosters to our own
infrastructure.

## Index
`hybrid-dump` allows to dump a MySQL-Database via HTTP by uploading a
small dump-script via FTP. Other tools like phpMyAdmin are not
required, it is all stand-alone.
